# Cloud Resume Challenge

![Architecture](palceholder.png)

This repository contains the code and infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts for my cloud-hosted resume. The application is hosted on AWS, leveraging services such as S3, CloudFront, and Lambda.
This project was done as part of a challenge to test my abilities using AWS cloud resources as a newly certified AWS Solutions Architect Associate and practice creating a practical infrastructure.

## Challenge Overview

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a popular cloud architect/engineer challenge aimed at showcasing and improving typical cloud architecture skills while also improving resume visibility.
The Cloud Resume Challenge serves as a platform for individuals to practice, demonstrate, and improve their cloud skills through the following methods:

#### Hands-on Experience
The challenge is designed as a hands-on project to build and demonstrate skills essential for a career as an AWS Cloud Engineer. Participants are required to construct a personal resume or portfolio website and include a visitor counter on the site. The project must be entirely deployed using various AWS services, providing a practical learning experience in handling cloud resources

#### Skill Development
It aids participants in developing crucial cloud skills, including setting up serverless applications, CI/CD pipelines, networking, and ensuring security. This aspect of the challenge is vital as it provides a real-world scenario for applying theoretical knowledge obtained from cloud certifications

#### Resume Enhancement
By participating in the challenge, individuals have the opportunity to enhance their resumes. The challenge allows them to present their resumes using cloud technologies, which not only showcases their technical skills but also makes their resumes more publicly and easily accessible.


## Challenge Stages

### 1. Certification

The first part of the challenge is to complete the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam. I decided to take this one step further and I successfully passed the [AWS Cloud Architect - Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/70a3664d-e78e-4ed6-9357-fa81fbb3c0e1/public_url) certification exam on 09/28/2023.

### 2. Frontend

This section is about building the visual design of the resume using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It doesn't need to be fancy, but it should have some styling rather than a raw HTML page.

#### 2.1  HTML & CSS

For the HTML portion of the website, I styled it after the sections of my normal resume with CSS styling to provide a somewhat modern design with some visual transitions.
Prior to this I had little to no experience writing HTML or CSS code, so I started with a template and made adjustments where needed for the basics. Then I made larger design changes to fit my overall design view.

The website contains separated sections that would typically be seen on a resume such as personal information, skills, work experience, education, certification, and personal projects. I also included links to my relevant socials as well as a link to download a copy of my official resume in pdf format.

The HTML code used for the website can be found [here](front-end/index.html)

#### 2.2  JavaScript

JavaScript

#### 2.3  Static Assets
#### 2.4  CloudFront

### 3. API

Detail the creation of the API, its endpoints, and how it interacts with the frontend and backend.

### 4. Backend & Integration

Explain the backend infrastructure, including databases and serverless functions, and how they integrate with the frontend and API.

### 5. CI/CD and Automation

Describe the continuous integration, continuous deployment, and automation processes set up for this project, including any tools and workflows used.
